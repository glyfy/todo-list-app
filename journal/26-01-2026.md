## What I built
- /tasks API endpoint

## What I learned
Assume user input is always nefarious, so it needs to be type checked and sanitized. 

Invalid user input (especially non optional data) should not crash the code there should be a controlled response and status sent back (if needed).

## What can be improved in my project
Better validation of user input at compile time and run time
Better definition of API contracts so that frontend and backend can interact predictably
Plan out code behaviour and stories better in advance to determine how backend and frontend will behave
